 youtube not allowing to reupload updated video to the same url where it was before to keep likes, views etc. 
 I am creating chrome extension that can extend video.
I can add timeline instuctions e.g to pause video at certain time for several seconds, 
within that time I can display canvas on top of video where I can put animated canvas elements, gifs, play other video or audio.

I want to enhance video, if video creator forget something to do in video and then uploaded it to youtube, 
he cannot add new part to video, so the chrome extension is suppose to add instruction 
like pause video for 3 seconds show different content on top of video and resume original video. 
I dont you to write code, try to predict and give me key points why people could use this extension, 
I gave you one example (stop video for few seconds and play e.g. gif with some audio then resume) 
how to enhance original video, now you give me more ideas. 
Also I want you to think how is target auditory and how people might interact with this extension and augmented video





this chrome extension suppose to enhance Youtube video
the instructions of this chrome extension could help with:

skip unwanted content
pause video and show new content
create a summary where user can watch 10 video fragments for few seconds instead of watching full video
new tab in EditPage to show gif comments
interaction with videos dynamically, display prompts or quizzes during pause instruction
video owner or other users can augment the same video, allow multiple video augmentation, share augmented version
